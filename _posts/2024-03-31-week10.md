## Thoughts of Our Group Projects
Our team had three meetings this week, one in-person in Wednesday's class and other two online. For this week, our group explored two issues from github. For the [gif animation bug](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6925), Brad requested for working on this 5 days ago, but he haven't been assigned to this one till now. For the other [text alignment issue](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6893), Robin shared his understanding in the comments. We are also trying to find some issues in this projects, as Rodin suggests that this projects seems does not support displaying Chinese characters, but as I researched that it is related to the font in this project. If we add a open source font that supports Chinese characters, then it is ok to display.

## Does Open Source Mean Secure?
There is a huge incident in open source community this Friday, the [XZ Utils backdoor](https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/). The developer, JiaT75(Jia Tan), created account in 2021. Then in April 2022, Jia Tan submitted a patch, and someone else requested Lasse Collin to add Jia Tan as a maintainer to XZ. In 2023, Jia Tan already gained trusted completely, so he merged his code, and started his malicious injection.
