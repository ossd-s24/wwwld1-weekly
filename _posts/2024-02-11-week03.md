# Git Exercise and Browser Extension
## Git Exercise
Before our class activity, I would say that I am kind of familiar with basic git, but when I faced a merge conflict, I just became nervous and wasn't sure if I could solve the problem. During this week's class, we reproduced the merge conflict scenario and solved it step by step. Now I can solve similar situations more confidently.

## Browser Extension
Our team is working on a pomodoro timer browser extension. In our extension, the user should focus for 25 mins and then take a 5 mins break. I think so far we don't have some big problems, and each one in the team has some specific work to do. I focus on the browser pop-up page, and I also have some non-coding work, such as finishing the Code of Conduct and Contributing file for our open source project. This is an interesting experience, I think it is a good start for us to get familiar with how to build and contribute to an open source project.
