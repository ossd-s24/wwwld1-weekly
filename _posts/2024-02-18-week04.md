# Browser Extension
## Group Work
During the browser extension project, our team had a great time. We divided the tasks into three parts and everyone in the team can contribute to the best of their ability. For me, I implemented the Firefox pop-up part. I also tried something new because I took part in the non-coding part. I implemented the contributing file and code of conduct, I am also happy to see that some of my classmates contributed to our project by following the contributing guidelines. Some of them found issues in our add-on, and they also started to fix one of them by creating pull requests. Learning how to maintain and run an open-source project is something new to me.
## Projects From Other Teams
During the in-class presentation, I think some of them are very interesting, such as [tyler1ify](https://github.com/ossd-s24/tyler1ify) and [studyTool](https://github.com/ossd-s24/studyTool), these endless overlaying images are so amusing.
