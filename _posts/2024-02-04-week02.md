# Code of Conduct
## Importance of Code of Conduct 
Why would we need the Code of Conduct?  I think the Code of Conduct is just a kind of moral restrict over the developers, it is not a law or a clause. If we want to maintain one project and there are a bunch of developers, we need these conducts to restrict them and make the community a place that is conducive to discussion rather than full of arguments and conflicts. 

Before learning this topic, I didn't realize the importance of the Code of Conduct, but after these, I knew that the Code of Conduct can also be very easy, it can be based on some other Code of Conduct, so I am also thinking about adding the Code of Conduct for projects that I am currently maintaining. 

## A Realistic Way of Enforcing Rules from Code of Conduct
As I mentioned that the Code of Conduct is only a moral restrict, so how can we restrict some individuals who do not follow the rules and disrupt the community environment? I think one way is voting. We can ask developer to vote on some mis-behaviors, if the majority of people agree that this behavior is rude and impresses the community environment, then they can kick him out of the community.
